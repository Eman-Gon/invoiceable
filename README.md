# INVOICEABLE
## AI-Powered Invoice Processing System

**INVOICEABLE** is an intelligent invoice processing application that transforms manual invoice handling into an automated, AI-driven workflow. Built for the California State University system, this tool extracts structured data from PDF invoices using advanced AI models and provides real-time analysis capabilities.

## üéØ Project Overview

Traditional invoice processing is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires significant manual effort. AP clerks spend an average of 12 minutes per invoice on data entry tasks.
